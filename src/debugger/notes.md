# debugger

We can have something similar to gdb or Python debugger,
a command line driven debugger.

We could set breakpoints to specific file:lines, 
keep track of them as we are executing, and break
when we reach the respective line.

Of course we can also:

- step, step over, step into, step out.
- inspect (and change) local variables, global variables
- evaluate expression!!!!
