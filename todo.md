# todo

* implement control structures parsing, e.g.
`if`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `for`, ~~`?:`~~
* implement parsing of functions
* implement ability to execute script by file


## later

Ability to parse EBNF syntax and then parse things on the fly?



# done!

* implement loading script from file to execute (add line numbers as well)
* make "containable" something to pass to containers, not to the items themselves...
* implement function calling, for built-in functions, e.g.
`length()`, `str()`, `int()`, `float()`, `substr()`, `index()` etc
* parsing of expressions, using shunting yard, correct execution and saving!
* extract tests in their own files, go style
* split parser - lexer into directories
